INNLab is a Python package that provides easy access of using Invertible Neural Networks (INNs). In this package, we included following INN practices:

* NICE
* RealNVP
* Residual Flow

* Other supporting blocks (resize, reshape, invertible batchnrom, invertible pixel shuffle, etc.)

> This package is used in this paper: Yanbo Zhang, and Sara Imari Walker. "A Relational Macrostate Theory Guides Artificial Intelligence to Learn Macro and Design Micro." arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.07374 (2022). https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07374

# Install

In the project folder, run:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

The package requires PyTorch >= 1.8.0. If it is lower than it, you will not be able to use `INN.PixelShuffle2d`.
